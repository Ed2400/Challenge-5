Module 5 Challenge

Details Observed During Analysis.

-Capomulin and Ramicane are the most used Drug Regimens, they also have the lowest mean of final tumor volume wich make them the most effective methods.

-The Weight and tumor size (mm3) has a linear proportion, this means, the weight on the mouse has be controlled if Capomulin Regimen is being used to reduce the size of the tumor.

-Infubinol and Ceftamin tend to have a certainty on effectiveness, with Ceftamin having a wide range of results in tumor size.
-The study was well balanced on the gender, 49% females to %51 males, which gives a great sense of accuracy.
